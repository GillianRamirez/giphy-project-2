Overview 
- The purpose of this website is to create a giphy search engine that allows users to enter and submit a keyword,
  which then makes a request to the Giphy api based on the specific keyword, recieves and parses the response with
  a custom css grid to display the generated images, and ensures the site is responsive so that it looks good/works
  well on both desktop and mobile devices.
  
How to use Website
- The homepage directly brings the user to the Giphy search Engine, where the user can enter and submit a keyword
  into the box next to "Search: " to then recieve a response from the generator after pressing the "go" button.
- At the bottom of the website title of "GIPHY Search API", a thin and long rectangular toggle button can be clicked

- The contact page lets users input their first and last names, along with the email the recipient will be recieving
  once the users submit their messages.

Technologies used
- .html, .css, .js

- Blank Space: I feel like I did better with trying to use some box-text designs have somewhat
